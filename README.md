Project made for Worldline, a payment and transaction services company: 

The R&D team was developing interactive demos of payment solutions for the business team. The demos were web applications presenting a succession of views based on an MQTT request system. However, debugging was time-consuming because the team had to create test sets from scratch.

My missions for Worldline
✓ Developed a web application allowing the R&D team to debug interactive demonstrations with an MQTT broker and predefined requests created or stored (Vue.js, Spring Boot, MVC, Docker)
✓ Developed a mobile application permitting the detection of product expiration date with the camera (Java Android)
✓ Reviewed other projects code (PHP, HTML/CSS, JavaScript)

The developed internal tool allowed the team to save time on a daily basis in the debugging of their demos.Payment and transaction services company: The R&D team was developing interactive demos of payment solutions for the business team.
